# Applying Filters on Images Using Python (cImage,Turtle)

#### The project has two parts.

- **Program A:** Coverts source image by **cImage** and saves the output as **.gif** format in outputs directory, also
  logs its path.
- **Program B:** Reads paths from the log file (outputs.txt) and displays the images by **Turtle** library.
